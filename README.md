###Chess with modding support ♟
My goal in this project is to make simply good chess, with my own improvements for the interest of the player.
One of these improvements will be mods. Why not use an oil mod for chess? Why not make chess versus checkers? 🤔

All that's left to do is ☕:
- ♟ Check (standard modification) `Maximum priority ⚠`
- 📁 Loading mods
- 🎊 Normal particle system (standard modification utility)
- 🧹 Code improvement and cleanup
- 🧱 Make the game as independent as possible from the standard modification
- 📃 Create docs about modding

About the window, input, rendering engine used for this project 🚂:
I don’t recommend anyone to use it, besides, the version on the engine page is older than the one used here.
The engine requires a complete rewrite for OpenGL.

Help at will 💁‍:
Although this is purely my project, I am not against helping in the development of this project.
If you want to help with pull requests, I don't mind 😊. As a thank you, I will leave a mention of you here.
